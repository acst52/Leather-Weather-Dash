# Where in the world is it Sweater Weather?
## Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

In this challenge we were tasked to build a weather dashboard from scratch! 
Using the OpenCageData API to convert user's searches (of city name, or city name + province/state/country) into coordinates, then feeding them into the OpenWeatherMap API, we retrieved and displayed the current weather + a 5-day-forecast, including the temperature, humidity and wind speed. We also saved user's searches so they could click on cities they had previously searched for, and review the weather there, again! Have a look at my Weather Dashboard [here](https://acst52.github.io/Sweater-Weather-Dash/).

### User Story

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
